Natours is a fullstack web app made with a purpose of selling tours around the world for a fictional travelling company. It was my first, yet how massive step into JavaScript back-end world. It allowed me to relearn the fundamental back-end concepts I learned when building my first fullstack project in Django, **[Chandra](https://github.com/Wisieneu/chandra)** and extend them massively in the direction of becoming a full-time Backend Developer. It was a very pleasant, challenging experience and I enjoyed every single second of it. 

### Thanks to this project I learned essential back-end concepts and implemented:
- 📃How to create an API
- 🎮MVC Architecture
- 👩‍💻User Authentication
- 📚Data Modelling
- 💳On-site payments
- 🤳File Uploading
- 📌Realtime Map integeration using Mapbox

Optimizations:
- Webpack as a script bundler instead of Parcel  
- Used a much newer version of Stripe for on-site payments
